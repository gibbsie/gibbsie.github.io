When approaching the notion of adopting Cloud, it can be a daunting task. You're faced with establishing a strategy, identifying your approach, commercials, governance, operational changes, people skills. Where do you begin?

Based on the numerous adoptions I've worked through, I recommend leveraging the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework as a guide to establishing a pathway through some of these decisions and realising business value, faster.

## What is the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Amazon Web Services Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) is a framework originally developed by AWS Professional Services (ProServ) to help organisations design and travel an accelerated path to successful cloud adoption. The guidance and best practices provided by the framework help you build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing across your organisation and throughout your IT lifecycle.

Using the AWS CAF helps you realise measurable business benefits from cloud adoption faster and with less risk.

We'll first introduce how the CAF is organised, then focus in on our main area of focus, namely Security.

## How is the AWS CAF organised?

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) organises guidance into six areas of focus, called perspectives. Each perspective covers distinct responsibilities owned or managed by functionally related stakeholders. In general, the Business, People, and Governance Perspectives focus on *business* capabilities; while the Platform, Security, and Operations Perspectives focus on *technical* capabilities.

Let's briefly introduce each of the six perspectives.

## Business Perspective

The Business Perspective helps you move from separate strategies for business and IT to a business model that integrates IT strategy. Agile IT strategies are aligned to support your business outcomes, and they can adjust to business needs or technical capabilities as they change.

Common Roles: Business Managers; Finance Managers; Budget Owners; Strategy Stakeholders.

## Platform Perspective

The Platform Perspective helps you design, implement, and optimize the architecture of AWS technology based on business goals and objectives. It helps provide strategic guidance for the design, principles, tools, and policies you will use to define AWS infrastructure.
